		<h2>Musuem Climate Monitoring System</h2>

		<p>
			As a thesis project, myself and a group of three other students developed a full climate monitoring system for The Lelooska Foundation, a native american cultural center in Vancouver, WA <a href="http://lelooska.org/">(See Site)</a>.
		</p>
		<p> 
			We constructed sensors that measured humidity and temperature in various cases.

		<p>
		 The sensors communicate to a secure website that we designed for Foundation staff to access and use the data collected.

			The system was designed to be self-sufficient without any developers maintaing the code, as well as enabling the museum to expand the system with more sensors. Extensive documentation on usage, troubleshooting, and sensor construction contribute to this overarching goal.

		<h2>Unibake</h2>

		<p>
			A semester-long project for a Databases course, Unibake was a software meant to foster relationships between undergraduate students through the power of baked goods. Students would make bake requests on the site, be paired with others based on availability and food preferences, and then receive possible recipes to bake together. The aspect of random pairing by preference encourages connections to be formed between students that may otherwise not occur, further tightening the undergrad network. We also intentionally set the website up to be useable between multiple campuses without forcing schools to store data locally.
